Installation
============

**biome** was `tested`_ on Python 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5. Python
2.6 and PyPy are not currently supported.

As `pathlib`_ was introduced in Python 3.4, you will need the
`backport`_ if you wish to install **biome** on prior versions of
Python.

**biome** can be installed with `pip`_ or `easy_install`_, although
pip is recommended.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install biome
